# Virtual Camera

Goal of this project is implementing a simple rendering engine, which allows moving around a virtual world.

The project consists of 3 iterations:

1. Implement fundamental operations to allow observer to fully explore the world
2. Implement elimination of covered elements (or in gamer words - drawing objects without wall hack)
3. Implement lighting
